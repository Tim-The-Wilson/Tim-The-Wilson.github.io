Can a mathematician break into finance?

**Absolutely.**

Iâ€™ve spent over a decade in data science and analytics, solving problems and driving decisionsâ€”and now Iâ€™m using those skills to launch a new chapter in finance. 

Hereâ€™s the short version of my journey:

âœ¨ **Senior Data Scientist** with expertise in product and marketing analytics.  
ðŸ“Š **10+ years** teaching and consulting in business analysis, statistics, and financial literacy.  
ðŸŽ“ **Currently pursuing an MBA** and prepping for the SIE and CFA exams.  
ðŸš€ **Launching a business** to help others transition into finance and analytics with confidence.

This is just the beginning.
