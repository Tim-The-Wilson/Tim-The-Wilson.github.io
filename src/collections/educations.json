		"description": "My doctoral research in Complex Dynamics, under the mentorship of Mariusz Urba≈Ñski, focused on Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems. I investigated the existence and continuity of conformal measures within the framework of thermodynamic formalism, particularly addressing challenges posed by parabolic points and their impact on Julia sets. This work involved developing new analytical methods to explore the interplay between dynamical behavior and topological properties, providing deeper insights into the stability and dimensional characteristics of these complex structures. Through this intensive research, I honed the ability to delve deeply into complex problems, thoroughly exploring existing literature and methodologies. This process required assimilating a vast array of theoretical concepts and technical approaches. When existing tools proved insufficient, I developed new techniques to advance understanding in the field. This experience cultivated strong problem-solving skills, analytical thinking, and the capacity to innovate within rigorous mathematical frameworks.",
